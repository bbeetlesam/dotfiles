# .dotfiles

This is technically a dump land for my dotfiles, act as a backup if I ever fucked up a thing while configurating my lovely Archcraft. You might find these as messy, as these are mine nevertheless.

If you want to use my configs, go ahead, but caution:\
It's not well made, and it could be broken on you.\
Use them on full responsibility.

## Contents

These are all the list of program that has its own spaces in this dotfiles repo:

- Neovim (contains both local and Lazy plugin config)
- Git
- bspwm *and* sxhkd
- Zsh shell (with Oh-My-Zsh)

That's it. Goodbye folks.
