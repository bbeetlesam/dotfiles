# .dotfiles

This is technically a dump for my dotfiles, mainly as a backup if I ever fuck a thing while configurating my lovely Archcraft.

If you want to use my configs, go ahead, but caution:\
It's not well made, and it could be broken on you.\
Use on full responsibility.

That's it. Goodbye folks.
